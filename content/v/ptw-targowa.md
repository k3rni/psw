PTW Performance Center is a storage facility repurposed into PTW's training center, and venue for its Underground series of events.  In its typical setup for such events, it fits a standard wrestling ring and about 150 seats for the audience. The back wall (visible to the hardcam) features colorful decorations made of wooden cargo pallets and graffiti.

## Location

The facility is located inside the [Międzynarodowe Targi Katowickie][mtk] (_Katowice International Fair_) grounds. The Fair is defunct since 2011, and leases its buildings to various commercial tenants. While named after Katowice, the grounds are actually located in Chorzów, a neighboring city in the Silesian metropolis. It's easily reachable by bus from Katowice's main railway station.
